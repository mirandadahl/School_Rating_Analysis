# School Rating Analysis

Analysis:

One of the major aspects that were looked at when considering school scores for math and reading was budget. Average scores for students decreased when larger quantities of money were spent per student. 

Looking at the percentage of overall passing, schools spending less than $585 per student had a passing rate of 90.37%. Schools spending between $585-630 per student had an overall passing rate of 81.42%. Schools spending between $630-645 per student had an overall passing rate of 62.86%. Finally, schools spending between $645-680 per student had an overall passing rate of 81.42%. 

When looking at school size, small schools (less than 1000 students) and medium schools (between 1000-2000 students) had similar scores for reading and math overall, with large schools (2000-5000 students) falling slightly behind. 

The overall passing percentage for small schools was 89.88%, 90.62% for medium schools, and 58.28% for district schools. This could be due to teachers having more time with students individually and helping them excel in things they donâ€™t understand. At larger schools, there may be less time to help each student that is potentially falling behind.
 
Overall, charter schools scored higher in all measured categories. The average reading scores were roughly 83.9 compared to district schools coming in at 80.97. The percentage of students passing reading for charter schools was 96.59% compared to district schools with an 80.8% passing rate for reading. 
Regarding math, the average scores were roughly 83.47 compared to district schools with an average score of approximately 76.96. The percentage of students passing math for charter schools was 93.62% compared to district schools with a 66.55% passing rate for math. The overall passing percentage for charter schools was 90.43% and 53.67% for district schools. This could be due to a number of factors, although not having funding is likely not the main one.

When looking at this data, charter schools with fewer students and less spending per student ranked higher in test scores compared to others.
